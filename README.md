# Static-Personal-Website-Wordpress-Version
Here its available the lines of code from my personal website (eduardobotelho.com), but converted to a wordpress theme format. <br>
The code its yet to be cleaned up, and it was written without much care, since I use it to experiment on some things too.

You can find the static version of this, built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/UPSxACE/Static-Personal-Website-Wordpress-Version">here</a>.
